<h2><strong> Side Effects and Data Fetching üíª </strong></h2>

<!-- slide -->

<h2><strong> ‚úÖ Objectives </strong></h2>

- Observe how to send a POST request via form
- Explain what a side effect is
- Observe how React manages side effects with the useEffect hook
- Observe how to use the useEffect hook to fetch data on page load
- Review changing parent state

<!-- slide -->

## Project Showcase Features

- Persist projects to database upon submitting the ProjectForm
- Load all projects from db on component load
- Load all phase 4 projects from db when users click on the phase 4 button
- Load all matching projects from db by phase and value in the search input
- Bonus: Add debouncing to search input so our search input only triggers a single fetch request when we type (rather than sending one for each keystroke)

<!-- slide style="text-align: left;" -->

## Warmup

Let's head over to `src/components/ProjectForm.js` and add in persistence.

### Logistics:
- `cd 05_side_effects_and_data_fetching/project_showcase`
- `npm run server`
- in another terminal: `npm install` then `npm start`

We want to be able to submit the form to create a new project, see the project appear in the DOM, reload the page and see it still appearing on the page!

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong> What to know before discussing side effects? </strong></h2>

<br>

The React components we've seen so far are 'pure functions'. This means that given an input(such as a props and state), the return is 100% predictable.

<br>

```js
const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
  return <h1> Hello, {name} </h1>;
};

export default Greeting;
```

<br>

Any time Greeting is called, and provided a new prop, we will always be able to predict the output, regardless of the prop value

<br>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong> What is a side effect? </strong></h2>

<br>

"We perform a side effect when we need to reach outside of our React components to do something. Performing a side effect, however, will not give us a predictable result."

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-useeffect-absolute-beginners/

<br>

The term 'side effect' not only applies to React but to all functional programming.

<br>

‚ÄúA side effect is anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed ‚Äù - Michael W. Brady

<br>

üí° These are operations that will still have an effect on our component, but won't happen during the rendering process (they'll happen after)

<br>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong> Examples of side effects</strong></h2>

<br>

- Fetching Data from a server

- Interacting with a browser API like the `document` or `window`
  - Utilizing interval timers such as `setInterval` or `setTimeout` 
  - adding a `mousemove` event listener to the `window` object

<!-- slide style="text-align: left;" -->

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong> üõ†Ô∏è useEffect() hook </strong></h2>

<br>

- `useEffect()` runs both upon the first render (afterwards) and then with every subsequent re-render. 
- we can limit when the effect will run again by specifying the values for props, state, etc. on which this effect depends

<br>

- Takes in two arguments:

  - A callback function defining the logic to be executed as a side effect(the 'effect')

  - A dependency array that defines when the side effect should occur. This argument is optional and does not always need to be provided

<br>

- `useEffect()` is essentially telling React that the component needs to do something else AFTER the component has rendered

<!-- slide -->

<p style="font-size: 2em">What useEffect Does</p>

- Synchronizes a side effect with a react component's rendering.

<!-- slide style="text-align: left;" -->

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong> 1Ô∏è‚É£ useEffect() hook without a dependency array  </strong></h2>

<br>

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // Some effect to occur
});
```

<br>

- In this example, only 1 argument is passed to useEffect

- The dependency array which is the optional second argument is left out

- That means that upon every render and re-render, this side effect will also execute

<!-- slide style="text-align: left;" -->

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong> 2Ô∏è‚É£ useEffect() hook with an empty dependency array  </strong></h2>

<br>

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // Some effect to occur
}, []);
```

<br>

- In this example, the dependency array is passed as the second argument

- The dependency array is empty with no provided value

- That means that the side effect will only run one time, upon the initial render of the component and no more after that. Even if the component is re-rendered

<!-- slide style="text-align: left;" -->

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong> 3Ô∏è‚É£ useEffect() hook with a value provided to the dependency array  </strong></h2>

<br>

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // Some effect to occur
}, [data]);
```

<br>

- In this example, the dependency array is passed a piece of data. This data can be either a prop or a state variable

- That means that the side effect will run once upon the components initial render and then only re-run when the value of the provided data changes

Let's go use this in our application by:
‚úÖ making sure that the projects we fetch from the database align with the phase we have selected by clicking one of the phase button filters
‚úÖ reworking the search input so it makes calls to our api when we type in the input rather than filtering through local state in react


<!-- slide style="text-align: left;" -->

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong> Cleaning up üßπ </strong></h2>

<br>

- There will be some code that is necessary to clean up after the component is no longer being mounted on the DOM. AKA turning off our side effects

- Why? To avoid 'memory leaks' which means using memory for data that is no longer necessary

- Examples: Timeouts, subscriptions, event listeners

- How? Return a cleanup function from the useEffect callback!

<!-- slide style="text-align: left;" -->

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong> Cleanup example </strong></h2>

<br>

```js
const Timer = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    let timer = setInterval(() => {
      setCount((count) => count + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(timer);
  }, []);

  return <h1>I've rendered {count} times!</h1>;
};
```

<br>

## When does cleanup happen?

  - During an update, if the side effect function will run again on this re-render, then the cleanup function will run first before the effect happens again.

  - When the component unmounts (is removed from the DOM)

  <img src="assets/react-component-lifecycle.png" alt="React component lifecycle diagram" height="800" />

<!-- slide -->

  **NOTE:** In Development when using React `StrictMode` (which we are):
  - components will be doubled rendered when they first mount to help you spot errors more easily 
  - the component will go through a mount and update right away
  - In the codesandbox demo, I removed Strict Mode so we can more easily understand what's happening with the cleanup.
  - In your own development it may seem like the cleanup function is running right when the component loads. The double render from StrictMode is the reason.

<!-- slide -->

## Debouncing

The problem:
- Right now a separate fetch request is sent to the server for every character we type into the search input - this causes janky rendering and multiple unnecessary repaints of the ProjectList component

The solution
- Debounce the search input!
  - use a separate piece of state to manage the search input
  - when that piece of state changes, schedule a change to the state variable that will trigger the fetch request for 300 milliseconds in the future
  - cancel the previously scheduled update to that state variable

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong> üí° Conclusion </strong></h2>

<br>

- Side effects run after first render
- Side effects run after every subsequent render where one of the values in their dependency array changes
- Any time a side effect function refers to a value in state or props, that value should be included in its dependency array (follow the eslint hints in your editor)
- If your side effect interacts with an external API or a native browser API like setInterval or setTimeout make sure to return a cleanup function to avoid memory leaks
- useEffect with an empty dependency array is your go to tool for fetching data when a component first loads
